Using Bayesian correlations to infer gene regulatory network

## Workflow of the BDGRN


![Workflow of the method](/fig1.png "BDGRN")
## Installation

BDGRN require packages

- igraph

- dplyr

- modEvA

- psych

- Matrix

- rsvd

- PRROC

If you need to install the package, for exmaple, "rsvd", You can run&#x20;

`install.packages("rsvd")`

## Datasets

All datasets used in this paper is listed ./data/

## Quick Start

You can start with example.R, which can directly used our algorithm to predict gene association on the example datasets

 `source("exmaple.R")`
